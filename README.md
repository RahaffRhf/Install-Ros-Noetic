## Step 2: Install Ubuntu 20.04 or Ubuntu MATE 20.04. I chose Ubuntu LTS, which you can download from this link: https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/.

## Step 3: Open VirtualBox and set the 'Virtual Machine Name and Operating System'. Name it whatever you like. Ensure you select 'Linux' and 'Ubuntu 64-bit,' as illustrated in the figure.

## Step 4: Assign the size of the virtual hard disk. A 20 GB hard disk size is sufficient. There are two options for creating a virtual hard disk; I chose to split the disk into multiple files. The advantage of splitting is that it makes it easier to copy the hard disk files to another computer.

## Step 5: Install Ubuntu MATE and, from the settings, go to 'System.' Select your Ubuntu ISO file, then finish the setup to start running it.
